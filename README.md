Model of Coincidence Detection in the Avian Brainstem, Neurocomputing

## Abstract:
We have constructed a detailed biophysical model of coincidence
detector neurons in the nucleus laminaris (auditory brainstem) which are
purported to detect interaural time differences (ITDs). In the model, ITD
coding is improved when the inputs from both ears are located on the
bipolar dendrites and segregated, over having both inputs on the soma:
the model behaves like the in vivo coincidence detectors. The model has
enabled us to explore features of the coincidence detector neurons
unexplained by a simpler biophysical model (Agmon-Snir et al., Nature
393 (1998) 262}272), including the effect of synapse location and
multiple dendrites.
